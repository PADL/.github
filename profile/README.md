Founded in 1999, PADL initially produced directory and authentication service offerings based on [RFC 2307](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2307) and [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)), including Novellâ€™s [Domain Services for Windows](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/open-enterprise-server/2023/acc_dsfw_secur_lx/fbadjaeh.html). Since 2018 we are developing audio software and hardware under the Lukktone moniker, such as [SwiftOCA](https://github.com/PADL/SwiftOCA).
